          removed.

        <p>Good Afternoon Mr. Frost, <br> <br>
          I am writing to ensure that you are aware of the <a
            href="https://irislc.github.io/HallsawMedia/Missing">article</a> that was posted in
          the Falset Times this morning. <br>
          I am sure that I do not need to put in writing why this is a problem for us, and we should do what we can to
          keep any more reporters from sticking their noses where they do not belong. I recommend the usual treatment
          for this Addison Hessil, and have already gone forward with contacting the Falset Times to ensure that this
          article can not be found after this morning's printing.</p>

        <p>Good Morning Hallsaw, <br><br>
          I was looking through what data we have been able to find from the Frostell lab's sudden vaporization, and I
          was able to recover about a minute of security footage from right before we lost contact with the personnel.
          This obviously raises infinitely more questions than it answers. But it seems that the dimension of Aequor
          holds far more mysteries than simply that of Frostell. <br>
          I will continue working to try and find what I can about what happened to our science team. We have released a
          statement to the press claiming that this was simply a gas explosion, and thankfully the public seems to have
          bought that.
        </p>
        <p>Best of luck with your continued experiments sir.</p>

        <br>
